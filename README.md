The Stock Scraper

I'm currently learning python, and thought this would be a good first project.

Currently the app writes stock prices to a DB or CSV.

Once I feel the DB is ready I will post the schema.

My plans are to make the program get not only prices but other info such as
low and high prices, eps, etc.
